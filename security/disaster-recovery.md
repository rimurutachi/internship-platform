# Disaster Recovery Plan - internship-platform

## Objectives

- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours

## Disaster Scenarios

| Scenario | Impact | Recovery Strategy |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Database failure | Critical | Failover to replica, restore from backup |
| Application server failure | High | Auto-scaling, deploy to new instances |
| Storage failure | High | Replicated storage, backup restore |
| Network failure | High | Multi-AZ deployment, CDN failover |
| Complete region failure | Critical | DR region activation |
| Ransomware | Critical | Isolated backups, clean restore |

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery
1. Assess extent of failure
2. Activate replica if available
3. Restore from most recent backup
4. Verify data integrity
5. Resume application connectivity

### Application Recovery
1. Deploy to new infrastructure
2. Restore configuration from IaC
3. Verify all services operational
4. Run smoke tests
5. Open to traffic

## Testing Schedule

- **Monthly**: Component recovery tests
- **Quarterly**: Full DR scenario test
- **Annually**: Complete DR exercise with stakeholders
